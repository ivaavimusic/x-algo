## What Changed?

This pull request updates X's algorithm. This may impact how the algorithm processes and displays content.

## Technical Details

## Description
This commit enhances an assertion on the log level
by using a shortened version for range comparison:
**x <= y <= z**
Instead of
**y => x and y <= z**

This exploits the language's syntactic sugar.
