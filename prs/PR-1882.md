## What Changed?

This change modifies content filtering. It may affect what content is hidden or removed from feeds.

## Technical Details

Limits all account level "shadow-banning" caused by blocks/mutes/unfollows to X days (configurable);

InteractionGraphNegativeJob.scala: `accountLevelShadowbanMaxTime = 1 //in days`

Rationale;
Account level censorship based on block/mute feature is easily gamified. Any censorship on this platform should be meticulously defined in the rules and performed at a content level.
