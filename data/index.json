This may increase discovery of relevant out-of-network content while maintaining safety standards.","devExplanation":"Initial commit adds core recommendation pipeline with Rust implementation. Includes candidate retrieval (candidate_pipeline.rs), filtering (filter.rs), and Grok-based transformer scoring.
