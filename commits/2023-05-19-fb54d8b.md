## For X Users

This update clarifies that Twitter's algorithm also powers notifications, potentially making them more relevant. It does not change what appears in For You timelines or how posts are ranked. The adjustments are documentation improvements that don't affect what users see or interact with.

## For Developers

Updated main README.md to include Notifications in product surfaces and added tweetypie to data components table. Renamed pushservice/readme.md to README.md with standardized capitalization. Removed trailing periods in bullet points across pushservice documentation for consistency.

## Tags

- docs
- engagement
- feature

## Technical Details

- renames pushservice readme.md to README.md
- Minor changes to main README.md
